# The Bible: TL;DR

The Bible: TL;DR is a simple Bible search tool built using React. The primary goal of the project is to provide a quick and painless way of searching the entire text of the Bible and comparing selected Bible verses in different translations. Additionally, the project was created to help the developer (me) learn and practice React. 

## Using the Tool

To get started, you can simply visit the project's website at [https://pentaxis93.github.io/the-bible-tldr](https://). The project is hosted on GitHub Pages, so there's no need to install anything locally.

The Bible: TL;DR is a simple tool that allows users to search for Bible verses using keywords or phrases. Users can choose from several different translations of the Bible, and the search results will be displayed in a user-friendly format.

To use the tool, simply enter a keyword or phrase in the search bar, select the desired Bible translation from the dropdown menu, and click the "Search" button. The search results will be displayed in a list format, and users can click on each result to view the full verse.
